In this project, Bhavcopy CSV files spanning from November to February were consolidated into a unified dataset. Leveraging the capabilities of the dplyr package in R, the dataset underwent a meticulous filtering process to extract pertinent information pertaining to specific stocks, notably BERGEPAINT and ASIANPAINT, along with their associated options (identified by INSTRUMENT=="OPTSTK"). Subsequently, the filtered dataset was subjected to a rigorous cleaning regimen, wherein extraneous data was discarded, and only essential columns such as STRIKE_PR, OPTION_TYP, OPEN_INT, and TIMESTAMP were retained for further analysis.

Following the data cleaning phase, the refined datasets for ASIANPAINT and BERGEPAINT options were meticulously exported into separate CSV files. Moreover, the code also encompassed a comprehensive data cleaning procedure for futures data linked to BERGEPAINT, ASIANPAINT, and NIFTY, with a focus on instruments denoted by INSTRUMENT=="FUTSTK" or "FUTIDX". This processed futures data was meticulously organized and then exported into a distinct CSV file, ready for subsequent analysis.

This project harnesses the power of the R programming language and pivotal libraries such as dplyr to execute efficient data manipulation and cleaning tasks. The resultant cleaned datasets serve as foundational pillars for conducting nuanced analyses and deriving actionable insights into prevailing trends within the derivatives market landscape.
